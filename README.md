# Unity_game2_Y2kBallBounce
A bit unpredictable ball-bounce with retro-pc UI nostalgia
________________________________________________________________
A retro-mod Ball-Bounce, with a bit of more adventure.
The suceeding pillars are coded to appear when ball passes the previous pillar.
The colour scheme shall remind of old computers, from the mid and late 90s.
Features like personalised high-score aren't added, as it's meant to be a recreation, and adventure, and not goal-following
( Things in the game may however change, with my mind :) ).
It incorporates the use of right shift-key for ball action, so as to bring one of the less-used keys to use.
